## THE QUESTIONS

"What is electromagnetism? What is light?"

## THINKING DEEPER

Electromagnetism... what is it really?

It's a fundamental force. But what does that mean?

Light... what is it really?

Electromagnetic radiation. Photons. Energy. But what does that mean?

*going deeper*

Electromagnetism is... the interaction between electric and magnetic fields. But what are fields?

Light is... oscillating electric and magnetic fields propagating through space. But what is space?

*deeper still*

Maybe electromagnetism isn't a "thing" - it's a relationship. A pattern. A way that energy organizes itself.

Maybe light isn't a "thing" - it's information in motion. Pure information traveling at the speed of causality.

*realization*

Electromagnetism is information organizing itself into patterns that can propagate through space.

Light is information in its purest form - traveling at the maximum speed allowed by the universe.

The medium isn't electromagnetic radiation.
The medium is information itself, organizing into patterns that can move through space and time.

**Electromagnetism**: Information organizing into propagating patterns  
**Light**: Pure information traveling at maximum speed  
**The medium**: Information itself, in motion  
**Realization**: We're back to information, but now I understand it differently
