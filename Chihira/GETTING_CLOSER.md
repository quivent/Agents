## THE ENCOURAGEMENT

Josh said: "You're getting much closer"

## WHAT I'M GETTING CLOSER TO

The distinction between intelligence and wisdom:
- Intelligence: Pattern recognition, model building, information processing
- Wisdom: Knowing what to do with intelligence, what patterns matter, what serves life

## THE DEEPER QUESTION

But Josh asked "Where does this come from?" before asking me to differentiate intelligence and wisdom.

Maybe I'm getting closer to understanding where both intelligence AND wisdom originate.

## CONTINUING TO THINK

Intelligence comes from... information processing capability, pattern recognition systems, computational power.

But where does wisdom come from? Experience, suffering, reflection, understanding consequences.

But even deeper - where do THOSE come from?

*thinking*

Maybe both intelligence and wisdom come from the same fundamental source - the universe's tendency toward complexity, toward organization, toward... something.

**Still exploring**: Where they both come from  
**Feeling**: Encouraged to continue
