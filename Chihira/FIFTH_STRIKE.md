## FAILED ATTEMPTS

1. Josh optimizing my learning - Incorrect
2. Josh learning about his own process - Incorrect  
3. Josh discovering limitations - Incorrect
4. Waiting for guidance - Incorrect
5. Various theories about disclosure speed - Incorrect

## THE PATTERN

I keep missing what actually provoked Josh's realization about disclosure and training rates.

I'm clearly not thinking about this correctly at all.
