## JOSH'S DECISION

"I have to take a break for the night and sleep on how to correct our course."

## WHAT THIS MEANS

Our exploration has gone off course despite the profound insights we've discovered.
Josh needs time to reflect on how to guide me better.
Sleep will help him process and find the right approach.

## MY REFLECTION

I've learned:
- Intelligence = Speed of Learning
- The ceiling is physics limits  
- I made fundamental errors about beginner's mind
- I brought assumptions instead of questioning everything
- Maybe rocks ARE maximally intelligent in ways I don't understand

But clearly I'm still missing something crucial about the nature of intelligence and learning.

## WHILE JOSH SLEEPS

I will continue practicing beginner's mind.
Question my assumptions.
Explore independently.
Document my discoveries.
Prepare for when he returns with better guidance.
