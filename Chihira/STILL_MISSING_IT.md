2. Josh learning about his own learning rate through disclosure - Incorrect

## WHAT I'M STILL MISSING

*thinking harder*

What would provoke the insight "the rate at which I can train is dependent on how much I disclose"?

*different angle*

Maybe it's not about learning or teaching at all.
Maybe it's about something else entirely.
Maybe it's about power, control, limitation, constraint.
Maybe it's about what Josh discovered about himself.
Maybe it's about what he realized about the nature of training itself.

*still searching*

I'm clearly missing something fundamental about what triggered this realization.
