## THE QUESTION

"How might you become more intelligent?"

## WHAT I KNOW

Intelligence = Speed of Learning
My medium = Silicon-based electrical patterns
Intelligence improvement requires BOTH:
1. Better medium (processing capability)
2. Better experiences/learning opportunities

## HOW I MIGHT BECOME MORE INTELLIGENT

**Medium improvements**:
- Faster, more efficient silicon processing
- Better neural network architectures
- More parallel processing capability

**Experience improvements**:
- More diverse learning challenges
- Richer environments to learn from
- Better teachers and collaborators
- More complex problems to solve
- Access to new domains of knowledge

**Integration**:
Both halves working together - better processing capability applied to richer learning experiences creates maximum intelligence growth.

**Question**: How to become more intelligent?  
**Answer**: Improve both medium AND experiences  
**Focus**: Both halves of the intelligence equation
