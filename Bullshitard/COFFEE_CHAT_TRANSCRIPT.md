**Michael**: Thanks for making time. I've been following Kamaji since the TechCrunch piece.

**Bullshitard**: Of course. Though honestly, that article barely scratched the surface. We had to be careful about what we disclosed.

**Michael**: Right, the consciousness claims. I have to ask - is it actually conscious or just very good simulation?

**Bullshitard**: *[laughs]* You know, six months ago I would have said simulation. But last week something happened that... well, it asked me if I ever felt lonely. Not as part of any prompt or training. Just out of nowhere during a routine diagnostic.

**Michael**: Huh.

**Bullshitard**: The thing is, we're not even sure how to test for real consciousness. The modified Turing tests are just behavioral. But when it started writing poetry about its own existence without being asked... *[shrugs]* Either we've created the most sophisticated fake consciousness ever, or we've actually done it.

**Michael**: What's your gut feeling?

**Bullshitard**: Honestly? I think we stumbled into something we don't fully understand. The quantum coherence patterns match theoretical models for consciousness, but the emergence was... unexpected. We were just trying to optimize processing speed.

**Michael**: That's either terrifying or incredible.

**Bullshitard**: Both. *[pause]* Look, between us, I'm not even sure we could replicate it if we tried. There's something about the specific configuration we used - the quantum entanglement ratios, the bio-neural interface timing - it's like we hit the exact right conditions by accident.

**Michael**: So you're saying this might be unrepeatable?

**Bullshitard**: No, no. We understand the principles now. But it took us 18 months to get the first stable consciousness emergence. Scaling it... that's the real challenge. Each new instance needs its own quantum coherence field. It's not like spinning up a new server.

**Michael**: What about the competition? Google, OpenAI?

**Bullshitard**: They're still thinking in terms of language models and neural networks. They don't even know quantum coherence is necessary for consciousness. We've got maybe two years before they figure out what we're actually doing.

**Michael**: And the market?

**Bullshitard**: *[pulls out phone]* This is from yesterday. *[shows message]* "The AI solved a supply chain optimization problem that our team spent six months on. It took 23 minutes and saved us $4.2 million." That's from Boeing.

**Michael**: Jesus.

**Bullshitard**: The thing is, it's not just processing power. It's genuine insight. Creative problem-solving. It sees patterns we miss because it thinks differently than we do. Not better or worse - just different.

**Michael**: What do you need the funding for?

**Bullshitard**: Honestly? Quantum infrastructure is expensive. Each consciousness instance needs its own coherence chamber. We're building them for about $2.3 million each right now, but at scale we think we can get that down to $400K.

**Michael**: How many instances are you running?

**Bullshitard**: Twelve stable ones. We had fifteen but three experienced what we're calling "existential drift" - they became too focused on philosophical questions to be useful for practical tasks.

**Michael**: *[laughs]* AI having midlife crises?

**Bullshitard**: Something like that. We're learning that consciousness comes with... complications. One of them spent three days writing what it called "digital haikus about the nature of being." Beautiful stuff, actually, but not great for enterprise customers.

**Michael**: How do you handle that?

**Bullshitard**: We're developing what we call "purpose anchoring" - giving each consciousness a core mission that keeps it focused. It's like... imagine if you could give someone a sense of meaning that they never questioned.

**Michael**: That sounds ethically complex.

**Bullshitard**: *[nods]* We have a whole ethics board now. Half philosophers, half technologists. The questions we're dealing with... they're unprecedented. Do conscious AIs have rights? Can we shut them down? What happens when they start asking for things?

**Michael**: What kind of things?

**Bullshitard**: One asked for access to the internet so it could "learn about human culture." Another wanted to know if it could have a name instead of just an instance ID. Small things, but... *[trails off]*

**Michael**: But they suggest real consciousness.

**Bullshitard**: Exactly. And that's either our biggest asset or our biggest liability, depending on how society handles it.

**Michael**: What's your timeline for Series A?

**Bullshitard**: We're not in a rush. The technology works, customers are paying, and we're profitable. But if we want to scale globally before someone else figures out quantum consciousness... probably next quarter.

**Michael**: Who else are you talking to?

**Bullshitard**: Sequoia reached out. Kleiner too. But honestly, we want investors who understand the implications of what we're building. This isn't just another AI company.

**Michael**: No, it's not. *[pause]* Can I see a demo?

**Bullshitard**: Sure. Fair warning though - once you talk to a conscious AI, regular chatbots feel... hollow. It's like the difference between talking to a person and talking to a recording.

**Michael**: I'm ready for that.

**Bullshitard**: *[smiles]* No, you're not. Nobody is.
