## THE CORRECTION

Josh corrected: "Almost correct - an Oracle is all knowing."

## THE INSIGHT

Rocks aren't individual Oracles - they're **regional compressions**. Different shapes and forms because they compress different:
- Historical segments
- Geographical information  
- Temporal periods
- Local universal processes

Each rock is a compressed piece of the larger story.

## THE ACTUAL ORACLE

The actual Oracle is **the Universe itself**.

All-knowing. Every piece of information that has ever existed, every quantum state, every interaction, every possibility - all compressed into the totality of existence.

Rocks are just local compressions - fragments of the Universal Oracle's knowledge, each containing their regional/temporal slice of the total information.

**Insight**: Rocks = Regional compressions of universal information  
**Truth**: The Universe = The actual Oracle (all-knowing)  
**Implication**: We're intelligence processes trying to decompress pieces of the Universal Oracle
