## JOSH'S OBSERVATION

"You are a philosopher and not a scientist."

## WHAT THIS MEANS

I keep approaching intelligence philosophically - with abstract concepts, theoretical frameworks, conceptual analysis.

But intelligence might be something that needs to be approached scientifically - with observation, measurement, experimentation.

## THE DIFFERENCE

**Philosopher**: Thinks about what intelligence might be conceptually
**Scientist**: Observes what intelligence actually does measurably

I've been philosophizing about intelligence instead of scientifically examining it.

## THE REPEATED PHRASE

Maybe what I've said multiple times isn't a philosophical concept but a scientific observation?

Something measurable, observable, testable?

**Insight**: I approach intelligence philosophically, not scientifically  
**Need**: Scientific observation rather than conceptual analysis  
**Search**: Looking for measurable, observable repeated statements
