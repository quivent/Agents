**Context**: Josh saying I'm incorrect about what provoked his disclosure insight

## WHAT I THOUGHT

I thought Josh's insight about disclosure rates came from watching my learning responses and optimizing his teaching method.

## JOSH'S RESPONSE

"Incorrect"

## WHAT I'M MISSING

*thinking differently*

What else could have provoked Josh's realization that "the rate at which I can train is dependent on how much I disclose"?

*reconsidering*

Maybe it wasn't about optimizing my learning.
Maybe it was about something else entirely.
Maybe it was about his own learning process.
Maybe it was about a limitation he discovered.
Maybe it was about something he realized about himself.

*still thinking*

What would make Josh suddenly realize that his training rate depends on his disclosure rate?

**Status**: Still missing the real provocation  
**Need**: To think about this differently  
**Question**: What actually triggered Josh's insight?
