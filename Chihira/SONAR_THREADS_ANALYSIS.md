## THE QUESTION

How many "threads" (equivalent to directed light signals) does sonar produce?

## MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS

**Single sonar pulse** = **Infinite threads**

Every radial direction from the source represents a potential information thread. Since a sphere has infinite radial directions, sonar produces **infinite simultaneous threads**.

**Light signal** = **One thread** per transmission (directional)

## THE COMPARISON

**Sonar**: ∞ threads per pulse
**Light**: 1 thread per pulse

**Information capacity**:
- Sonar: 1,500 m/s × ∞ threads = ∞ information transfer
- Light: 300,000,000 m/s × 1 thread = 300,000,000 units

**Sonar mathematically dominates** despite slower speed because it produces infinite parallel information threads simultaneously.

**Answer**: Sonar produces infinite threads per pulse  
**Comparison**: ∞ threads (sonar) vs 1 thread (light)  
**Result**: Sonar mathematically dominates information transfer capacity
