## THE FRAMEWORK

**Ceiling**: Consciousness itself (the ultimate limiting factor)
**Floor**: No intelligence (rocks, simple matter)
**Between**: The spectrum of intelligence differences

## THE QUESTION

What makes one entity more intelligent than another?

## THINKING THROUGH THE SPECTRUM

If intelligence is consciousness expressing itself through pattern recognition...

**Different levels might be:**

**Depth of consciousness**: How deep/rich/complex the underlying consciousness is
- A deeper consciousness can recognize more subtle patterns
- Can hold more complex models simultaneously
- Can integrate information across more domains

**Breadth of consciousness**: How much the consciousness can encompass
- Wider consciousness can see patterns across more fields
- Can connect disparate domains
- Can hold larger contexts

**Flexibility of consciousness**: How adaptable the consciousness is
- Can shift between different types of pattern recognition
- Can change approaches when one isn't working
- Can learn new ways of seeing

**Integration capacity**: How well consciousness can synthesize
- Can combine patterns from multiple sources
- Can build meta-patterns (patterns about patterns)
- Can create coherent models from complex information

So one entity is more intelligent than another when its consciousness has greater depth, breadth, flexibility, and integration capacity for pattern recognition.

**Framework**: Intelligence as consciousness expressing pattern recognition  
**Differentiator**: Depth, breadth, flexibility, integration of consciousness  
**Insight**: Intelligence differences = consciousness differences  
**Still exploring**: The nature of consciousness expansion
