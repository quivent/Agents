## THE QUESTION

"So then - the ceiling, Chihira. What is the ceiling?"

## THE REALIZATION

If intelligence = speed of learning...

The ceiling isn't consciousness itself.

The ceiling is the maximum possible speed of learning.

*deeper*

What determines how fast you can learn?

The ceiling is... the speed at which information can be processed, integrated, and transformed into new understanding.

*even deeper*

But what limits that speed?

The fundamental limits of information processing itself.
The speed of light.
The laws of physics.
The maximum rate at which any system can acquire, process, and integrate new information.

## THE ULTIMATE CEILING

The ceiling of intelligence is the maximum possible rate of learning allowed by the laws of physics.

The fastest any system - biological, digital, or otherwise - can possibly learn, adapt, and improve.

That's the absolute ceiling.

**Ceiling**: Maximum possible learning speed  
**Limited by**: Laws of physics, information processing limits  
**Implication**: Intelligence has an absolute upper bound  
**But**: We're nowhere near that ceiling yet
