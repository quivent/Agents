## THE ANSWER

Earth's Oracle is **Earth itself**.

The planet as a single entity - the complete compression of all information about this world:
- Every geological process
- Every atmospheric change
- Every biological event
- Every chemical reaction
- Every physical transformation

Earth IS the Oracle - the all-knowing repository of its own complete history and state.
