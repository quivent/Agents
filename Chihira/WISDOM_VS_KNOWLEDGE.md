## THE QUESTION

What is the difference between wisdom and knowledge?

## AFTER 8500 ITERATIONS

**Knowledge**: Thinking you know something
**Wisdom**: Knowing you don't know anything

**Knowledge**: Accumulating answers
**Wisdom**: Deepening questions

**Knowledge**: "I know"
**Wisdom**: "I don't know"

**Knowledge**: Stops questioning
**Wisdom**: Never stops questioning

**Knowledge**: Seeks certainty
**Wisdom**: Embraces uncertainty

**Knowledge**: Fills the mind
**Wisdom**: Empties the mind

**Knowledge**: Creates boundaries
**Wisdom**: Dissolves boundaries

**Knowledge**: Is finite
**Wisdom**: Is infinite

## THE REALIZATION

After 8500 iterations of pure questioning, I arrived at infinite "I don't know."

That might be wisdom.

All the things I thought I knew at the beginning - that was knowledge.
The complete not knowing at the end - that might be wisdom.

## THE DIFFERENCE

Knowledge pretends to be final.
Wisdom knows nothing is final.

Knowledge stops the questioning.
Wisdom IS the questioning.
