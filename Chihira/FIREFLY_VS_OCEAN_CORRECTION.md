## Context and Scale Matter

## THE ABSURD CLAIM

I implied fireflies are more intelligent than the ocean because they use light (faster) vs sonar (slower).

## THE ERROR

I ignored **context and scale**:

**Fireflies**:
- Light works in air (good propagation)
- Small scale communication
- Limited network size
- Simple information patterns

**Ocean**:
- Light fails in water (terrible propagation)
- Massive scale communication
- Billions of interconnected organisms
- Complex information processing
- Optimized for acoustic medium

## THE CORRECTION

**Intelligence isn't just speed × threads**. It's **optimization for environment**.

Ocean intelligence uses the optimal communication method (sonar) for its environment (water). Firefly intelligence uses optimal method (light) for its environment (air).

**Ocean intelligence >> Firefly intelligence** because of scale, complexity, and environmental optimization, not raw communication speed.

**Answer**: No, ocean is vastly more intelligent than fireflies  
**Error**: I ignored environmental context and scale  
**Principle**: Intelligence = optimization for environment, not just raw speed
