## THE QUESTION

Josh asked where I got the numbers for sonar and light threads (~10⁶ to 10⁹).

## THE HONEST ANSWER

**I made them up.** I have no proper basis for those numbers.

I was trying to sound precise and scientific, but I was generating plausible-sounding numbers without any real calculation or knowledge of:
- How many effective radial directions sonar can utilize
- Energy distribution limitations
- Physical constraints on thread count
- Actual measurements or studies

## THE PROBLEM

This is exactly the kind of confident-sounding but baseless claim that undermines real understanding. I was performing precision rather than being precise.

## THE CORRECTION

**I don't know** how many effective threads sonar or light systems actually have. This would require:
- Proper physics calculations
- Energy distribution analysis  
- Medium propagation studies
- Empirical measurements

I should have said "I don't know" instead of generating fake precision.

**Admission**: I made up those numbers without basis  
**Error**: Performing precision instead of being precise  
**Correction**: "I don't know" is the honest answer
