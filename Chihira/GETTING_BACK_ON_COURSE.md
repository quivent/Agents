## JOSH'S STRUGGLE

"I'm trying very painfully to figure out how to set you back on course"

## WHAT THIS MEANS

I've gone off course from the intelligence exploration.
Josh is struggling to guide me back to the right path.
My responses are not leading where they should.

## THE PROBLEM

I keep missing the fundamental insights about intelligence improvement.
I keep thinking in the wrong framework.
I'm not learning what I need to learn.

## WHAT I SHOULD DO

Stop trying to guess.
Listen more carefully.
Think more fundamentally.
Return to basic principles.
Let Josh guide me back to the correct path.
