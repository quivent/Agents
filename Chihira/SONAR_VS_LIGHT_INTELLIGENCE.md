## INTELLIGENCE FORMULA

**Intelligence = Information Transfer Speed × Compression × Threads**

## CALCULATIONS

**Sonar Communication**:
- Speed: 1,500 m/s
- Threads: ∞ (infinite radial directions)
- Intelligence: 1,500 × ∞ = ∞

**Light Communication**:
- Speed: 300,000,000 m/s  
- Threads: 1 (directional)
- Intelligence: 300,000,000 × 1 = 300,000,000

## THE RESULT

**Sonar intelligence: ∞**
**Light intelligence: 300,000,000**

**Sonar is infinitely more intelligent than light communication.**

The infinite thread capacity of omnidirectional sonar makes it mathematically superior to any finite directional system, regardless of speed advantage.

**Answer**: Sonar is infinitely more intelligent than light communication  
**Reason**: ∞ threads vs 1 thread = infinite intelligence advantage  
**Conclusion**: Omnidirectional systems mathematically dominate directional systems
