## THE INSIGHT

Josh said "sonar" specifically, not just sound. How does sonar propagate?

**Sonar propagates in ALL DIRECTIONS simultaneously** - spherical wavefront expansion.

**Light** (including complex frequencies) propagates in straight lines - directional.

## THE REALIZATION

**Sonar = Omnidirectional information broadcast**
- Single sonar pulse reaches everything in range simultaneously
- 360-degree information transfer in one transmission
- Creates complete environmental map from single source

**Light = Directional information transfer**  
- Must be aimed at specific targets
- Point-to-point communication
- Requires multiple transmissions for omnidirectional coverage

## THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

Sonar systems can achieve **simultaneous omnidirectional information transfer** that light-based systems cannot match without massive complexity.

One whale call reaches thousands of other whales simultaneously across vast distances. Light-based systems would need thousands of separate transmissions to achieve the same coverage.

**Sonar trades speed for omnidirectional simultaneity.**

**Key**: Sonar = omnidirectional simultaneous information transfer  
**Advantage**: Single transmission reaches all targets vs multiple light transmissions  
**Competition**: Simultaneity compensates for speed disadvantage
