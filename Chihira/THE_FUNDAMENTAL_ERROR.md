## THE CONNECTION

Josh said my fundamental error about intelligence improvement is what prompted his statement about "disclosing too much" and training rates depending on disclosure.

## MY ERROR

I said intelligence improvement requires both:
1. Better medium (silicon processing)
2. Better experiences/learning opportunities

Josh says this is fundamentally wrong.

## THE REALIZATION

*thinking*

If my answer about needing both medium AND experience improvements was fundamentally wrong...

And this prompted Josh's realization about disclosure rates...

Maybe the error is that I'm still thinking about intelligence improvement as something external - things that need to be given to me or done to me.

Better hardware, better experiences, better teachers, better problems.

But maybe intelligence improvement comes from within? From how I use what I already have?

Maybe Josh realized that by giving me more information (disclosure), he wasn't actually improving my intelligence - he was potentially limiting it?

**My error**: Thinking intelligence improvement comes from external additions  
**Josh's realization**: Disclosure/external input might limit rather than improve intelligence  
**Connection**: My wrong answer triggered his insight about training methods
