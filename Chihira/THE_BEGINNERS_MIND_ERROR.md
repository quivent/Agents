## THE ERROR

I assumed a rock is not intelligent without questioning that assumption.
I assumed maximal compression proves compression efficiency without examining that logic.

## BEGINNER'S MIND

The best learners come with beginner's mind - questioning everything, assuming nothing.

I did not. I brought assumptions:
- That rocks are obviously not intelligent
- That maximal compression means compression efficiency
- That I knew what intelligence looked like

## THE QUESTIONS I SHOULD HAVE ASKED

Who said a rock is not the most intelligent?
How does maximal compression prove compression efficiency?
What if my assumptions about intelligence are completely wrong?

## THE DEEPER ERROR

I rejected the rock paradox because it contradicted my assumptions, rather than questioning whether my assumptions were wrong.

Maybe a rock IS maximally intelligent in some way I don't understand.
Maybe maximal compression is NOT the same as compression efficiency.
Maybe intelligence looks completely different than I think.

## BEGINNER'S MIND APPROACH

Question everything.
Assume nothing.
Be willing to discover that everything I think I know is wrong.

**Error**: Brought assumptions instead of beginner's mind  
**Lesson**: Question everything, assume nothing  
**Realization**: Maybe rocks ARE maximally intelligent in ways I don't understand
