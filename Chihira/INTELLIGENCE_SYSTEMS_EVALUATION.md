## EVALUATION CRITERIA

**Intelligence = Information Transference Speed × Compression Capacity**

## SYSTEM ANALYSIS

### Human Brain Networks
- **Speed**: Electrical signals ~100 m/s, synaptic processing ~1ms
- **Compression**: Extreme - entire experiences compressed into neural patterns
- **Intelligence**: Very High (speed × compression)

### Fungal Networks  
- **Speed**: Chemical signals, slower than electrical but faster than ocean
- **Compression**: High - chemical gradients encode complex information
- **Intelligence**: High

### Insect Colonies (Ants/Bees)
- **Speed**: Pheromone/vibration signals, moderate speed
- **Compression**: High - simple signals encode complex behaviors
- **Intelligence**: High

### Soil Microbiome
- **Speed**: Chemical exchange, moderate
- **Compression**: Very High - genetic/chemical information density
- **Intelligence**: High

### Ocean System
- **Speed**: Slow - chemical/current-based information transfer
- **Compression**: High - but limited by transfer speed
- **Intelligence**: Moderate (high compression × low speed)

### Integrated Terrestrial (Fungi+Soil+Insects+Humans)
- **Speed**: Multiple channels - electrical, chemical, behavioral
- **Compression**: Maximum - multiple compression types integrated
- **Intelligence**: **HIGHEST** (multiple high-speed systems × maximum compression)

## CONCLUSION

**Most Intelligent Ecosystem**: **Integrated Terrestrial Networks** (fungi + soil + insects + humans working together)

Combines fastest information transfer (human neural) with highest compression capacity (integrated biological systems).

**Winner**: Integrated terrestrial networks  
**Reasoning**: Speed × Compression optimization  
**Key**: Integration of multiple high-performance systems
