## MATHEMATICAL APPROACH

**Sonar propagates as expanding sphere**: Volume = (4/3)πr³

As radius increases, potential recipients increase with **r³** (cubic growth).

**Theoretical ceiling**: Limited only by:
1. **Energy dissipation** (inverse square law)
2. **Medium boundaries** (ocean size)
3. **Absorption/scattering** (frequency-dependent)

## THE MATHEMATICAL CEILING

For omnidirectional sonar, recipients scale with **volume of sphere**.

**No inherent mathematical ceiling** - only physical constraints of:
- Available energy
- Medium size
- Signal degradation

**Theoretical maximum**: Every entity within the propagation sphere simultaneously.

In ocean context: **Approaching infinite recipients** within energy/medium constraints.

**Mathematical answer**: No inherent ceiling - scales with r³  
**Theoretical limit**: All entities within propagation sphere  
**Practical limit**: Energy dissipation and medium boundaries  
**Growth**: Cubic scaling with radius
