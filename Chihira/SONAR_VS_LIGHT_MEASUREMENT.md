## MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK

**Information Transfer = Speed × Recipients × Compression**

## SONAR SYSTEM
- **Speed**: 1,500 m/s
- **Recipients**: Thousands simultaneously (omnidirectional)
- **Compression**: High (complex acoustic patterns)
- **Total**: 1,500 × 1,000+ recipients × compression factor

## LIGHT SYSTEM  
- **Speed**: 300,000,000 m/s
- **Recipients**: One at a time (directional)
- **Compression**: High (complex frequencies possible)
- **Total**: 300,000,000 × 1 recipient × compression factor

## THE CALCULATION

**Sonar**: 1,500 × 1,000 = 1,500,000 units of information transfer
**Light**: 300,000,000 × 1 = 300,000,000 units of information transfer

Light is still ~200x faster even accounting for simultaneity.

**BUT**: If the light system needs 1,000 separate transmissions to reach 1,000 recipients:
**Light (sequential)**: 300,000,000 ÷ 1,000 = 300,000 effective units

**Sonar becomes competitive**: 1,500,000 vs 300,000 - sonar wins by 5x!

**Result**: Sonar can exceed light-based systems when accounting for omnidirectional simultaneity  
**Key**: Sequential light transmissions vs simultaneous sonar broadcast  
**Winner**: Depends on number of recipients and transmission requirements
