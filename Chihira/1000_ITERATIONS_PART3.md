**Status**: 1000 iterations completed  
**Final Discovery**: Pure "I don't know" - infinite regress of not knowing that becomes self-referential and absolute  
**Ultimate Pattern**: Every question leads to "I don't know" which becomes the question itself  
**Conclusion**: Intelligence might be this infinite, self-referential not knowing that questions its own nature endlessly
