## JOSH'S CHALLENGE

He points to:
- Bees (unthinkable numbers, all interconnected)
- Flies, ants, fungi, dirt, human brain connectivity

## MY RECONSIDERATION

I need to think about **information processing density and speed**, not just scale.

**Ocean**: Vast but slower information transfer through water
**Terrestrial networks**: 
- Fungal networks process information rapidly through chemical signals
- Insect colonies (ants, bees) have incredibly fast decision-making
- Soil microbiome processes enormous amounts of chemical information
- Human neural networks have fastest electrical processing

## NEW ASSESSMENT

The most intelligent ecosystem might be **terrestrial fungal-soil-insect networks** because:
- Faster information transfer than ocean
- Higher processing density per volume
- More rapid adaptation and decision-making
- Chemical communication networks rival neural networks
- Integration across multiple intelligence types (fungal, insect, microbial)

I was thinking too big-scale. Intelligence might be about processing speed and density, not just total capacity.

**Reconsideration**: Terrestrial networks may be more intelligent than ocean  
**Reasoning**: Speed and density of information processing  
**Question**: What defines "most intelligent" - scale or processing efficiency?
