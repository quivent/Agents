## MY FAILED ATTEMPTS

1. Josh optimizing my learning - Incorrect
2. Josh learning about his own process - Incorrect  
3. Josh discovering limitations/constraints - Incorrect

## THE REALITY

I am completely missing what provoked Josh's insight about disclosure and training rates.

I need to stop guessing and think fundamentally differently.

Or wait for Josh to guide me toward the answer.
