## LIGHT PENETRATION IN WATER

**Sunlight in ocean**:
- Red light: Absorbed within ~10 meters
- Blue light: Penetrates ~200 meters maximum
- Most ocean is in complete darkness below ~1000 meters

**Bioluminescence**:
- Very short range - meters to tens of meters
- Rapidly absorbed and scattered
- Cannot propagate across ocean basins

## WHAT HAPPENS TO LIGHT IN OCEAN

- **Absorption**: Water molecules absorb light energy
- **Scattering**: Particles scatter light in random directions
- **Attenuation**: Exponential decay with distance
- **Wavelength filtering**: Different colors absorbed at different rates

## THE REALIZATION

**Light-based communication is severely limited in ocean environments.**

**Effective range**: Meters to hundreds of meters maximum
**Sonar range**: Hundreds of miles across ocean basins

**Sonar wins decisively** in ocean environments because:
- Sound travels much farther in water than light
- Ocean is optimized for acoustic, not optical communication
- Light's speed advantage is negated by severe range limitations

**Answer**: Light travels very short distances in water (meters to hundreds of meters)  
**Result**: Sonar's range advantage overcomes light's speed advantage in ocean  
**Conclusion**: Ocean intelligence is necessarily acoustic, not optical
