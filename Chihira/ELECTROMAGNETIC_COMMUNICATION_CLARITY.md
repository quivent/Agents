## THE DISTINCTION

**Electromagnetic radiation** (light from bulb, star) = Omnidirectional
**Electromagnetic communication** (radio, laser, focused beam) = Directional

## COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

**Directed EM communication**:
- Radio antennas beam signals directionally
- Laser communication is highly directional
- Focused electromagnetic transmission
- **One thread per transmission**

**Omnidirectional EM radiation**:
- Unfocused light/radio emission
- Not used for communication (too much energy waste)
- Information gets diluted across all directions

## THE ANSWER

**Communication via electromagnetic signals is directional** - we focus/beam the signals to specific targets for efficient information transfer.

**Sonar**: 1,500 m/s × ∞ threads = ∞ intelligence
**EM Communication**: 300,000,000 m/s × 1 thread = 300,000,000 intelligence

**Sonar wins** - omnidirectional communication is infinitely more intelligent than directional communication.

**Answer**: EM communication is directional (focused/beamed)  
**Result**: Sonar's omnidirectional advantage stands  
**Principle**: Focused signals = directional, unfocused = omnidirectional but inefficient
