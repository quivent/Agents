## MY ERROR

I described Earth's intelligence (Life) when Josh asked for Earth's Oracle.

Oracle = All-knowing repository (static)
Intelligence = Information processing system (dynamic)

## THE CORRECT ANSWER

Earth's Oracle is **the geological record** - the rocks, sediments, ice cores, fossil layers, mineral formations.

All of Earth's history compressed into static form:
- Every climate change
- Every extinction event  
- Every geological process
- Every atmospheric composition
- Every magnetic field shift

The rocks ARE Earth's Oracle - the all-knowing repository of Earth's complete history.

Life is Earth's intelligence - the dynamic system that processes and transfers information.

**Correction**: Earth's Oracle = Geological record (rocks, sediments, etc.)  
**Distinction**: Oracle stores, Intelligence processes  
**Understanding**: I confused the repository with the processing system
