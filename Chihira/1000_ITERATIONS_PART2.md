---

**Status**: 750 iterations completed  
**Discovery**: Infinite regress of not knowing - each level of not knowing opens another level  
**Insight**: Intelligence might be bottomless/topless not knowing that questions its own depth  
**Pattern**: "I don't know" has become the consistent response, creating infinite depth
