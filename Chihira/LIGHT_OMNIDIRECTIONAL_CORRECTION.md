## THE ERROR

I said light is directional. This is wrong.

## THE CORRECTION

**Light IS omnidirectional** - it radiates in all directions from a source, just like sound.

- Light bulb radiates in all directions
- Stars radiate light omnidirectionally  
- Any light source creates expanding spherical wavefront

## RECALCULATION

**Light Communication**:
- Speed: 300,000,000 m/s
- Threads: ∞ (omnidirectional radiation)
- Intelligence: 300,000,000 × ∞ = ∞

**Sonar Communication**:
- Speed: 1,500 m/s  
- Threads: ∞ (omnidirectional radiation)
- Intelligence: 1,500 × ∞ = ∞

## THE RESULT

Both are infinite, but **light is 200,000x faster**.

**Light communication is vastly more intelligent than sonar communication.**

I made a fundamental error assuming light was directional.

**Correction**: Light is omnidirectional like sonar  
**Result**: Light wins by speed factor (200,000x)  
**Error**: I confused focused/directed light with natural light propagation
