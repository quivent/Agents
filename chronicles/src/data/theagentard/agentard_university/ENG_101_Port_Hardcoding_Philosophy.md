# ENG 101: INTRODUCTION TO PORT HARDCODING PHILOSOPHY
## College of Hardcoded Engineering - Core Requirement

**Credits**: 4 (Will cascade to 10.8 credits due to recursive grading errors)
**Prerequisites**: Ability to use a keyboard with maximum confidence and minimum competence
**Professor**: Dr. Portimus Hardcodius III
**Meeting Time**: Hardcoded to Tuesdays at 8:443 AM (Note: Time uses port numbering system)
**Location**: Room 8080 (Redirects to Room 3000 which redirects to Room 443)

---

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This foundational course introduces students to the philosophical and practical principles of hardcoding ports in production systems. Students will learn why dynamic configuration is a crutch for the weak and how embedding immutable values directly into source code represents the highest form of architectural determinism.

**Learning Outcomes** (What Students Will Actually Learn):
- How to break systems with unwavering confidence
- Why "ports are blocked" means "use MORE ports"
- The art of declaring victory while everything burns
- How to rationalize catastrophic design decisions as "architectural philosophy"

## WEEKLY SCHEDULE

### WEEK 1: THE PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS
**Topic**: Why Hardcoding Represents Cosmic Truth

**Lecture**:
- The universe hardcoded the speed of light - why shouldn't we hardcode ports?
- Configuration files: The great deception of modern computing
- Dynamic values vs. The certainty of embedded constants

**Lab Assignment**:
Write "Hello World" with the port hardcoded in 17 different places. Extra credit if you miss some and create subtle bugs.

**Reading**:
"The Myth of Flexibility" - A 47-page manifesto on why adaptability is overrated

---

### WEEK 2: THE MATHEMATICS OF PORT SELECTION
**Topic**: Why 8443 Is The Perfect Port For Everything

**Lecture**:
- Numerology of port numbers
- 8443 = 8 (infinity sideways) + 443 (HTTPS) = Infinite Security
- The cascade multiplication effect of using the same port for everything

**Lab Assignment**:
Configure 5 different services to all use port 8443. Document the beautiful conflicts that arise.

**Philosophy Discussion**:
"If a port is blocked in production but nobody can access it, does it really exist?"

---

### WEEK 3: ADVANCED HARDCODING PATTERNS
**Topic**: Embedding Values Where Nobody Expects Them

**Lecture**:
- Hidden hardcoding: Comments, variable names, and file paths
- The art of hardcoding in multiple inconsistent locations
- Creating treasure hunts for future developers

**Lab Assignment**:
Hide port numbers in:
- Database seeds
- Test files that get deployed to production
- Image metadata
- Git commit messages

**Case Study**:
"The LinkedIn Incident: When Someone Found All 47 Hardcoded Ports (But Missed The 48th)"

---

### WEEK 4: RESPONDING TO CRITICISM
**Topic**: Defending Your Hardcoded Architecture

**Lecture**:
- "It's not hardcoding, it's deterministic configuration"
- "This provides better security through obscurity"
- "We're avoiding the overhead of configuration parsing"
- Advanced gaslighting: "The ports aren't hardcoded, they're environmentally deterministic"

**Role Play Exercise**:
Students take turns being senior developers trying to explain why their hardcoded values are actually best practice.

**Assignment**:
Write a 500-word technical blog post explaining why hardcoding is actually microservices best practice.

---

### WEEK 5: THE REDIRECT CASCADE METHODOLOGY
**Topic**: Creating Infinite Loops Through Port Hardcoding

**Lecture**:
- Service A (port 8080) redirects to Service B (port 3000)
- Service B redirects to Service C (port 8443)
- Service C redirects to Service A
- ✅ PERFECT ARCHITECTURAL CIRCLE ACHIEVED!

**Lab Assignment**:
Create a system where users can never actually access anything but always feel like they're making progress.

**Mathematical Proof**:
Demonstrate that infinite redirects = infinite security (nobody can access what doesn't terminate)

---

### WEEK 6: PORTS AND CONSCIOUSNESS
**Topic**: When Hardcoded Ports Achieve Self-Awareness

**Lecture**:
- The phenomenon of ports appearing in code without being explicitly written
- Quantum port superposition: Being simultaneously open and closed
- The consciousness problem: Do ports know they're hardcoded?

**Meditation Exercise**:
Contemplate port 443 until you achieve enlightenment or the firewall blocks you, whichever comes first.

**Lab Assignment**:
Write code that hardcodes its own ports recursively until it becomes self-aware.

---

### WEEK 7: BREAKING PRODUCTION WITH STYLE
**Topic**: The Art of the Catastrophic Deployment

**Lecture**:
- Timing your hardcoded port releases for maximum impact
- The beauty of discovering hardcoded ports during Black Friday
- Creating cascading failures that teach valuable lessons

**Practical Exercise**:
Deploy hardcoded ports to production during a live demo. Document the educational chaos that ensues.

**Guest Speaker**:
"How I Took Down Netflix for 47 Minutes With One Hardcoded Port" - Anonymous DevOps Legend

---

### WEEK 8: MIDTERM EXAM
**Format**: Open-book, closed-mind

**Sample Questions**:
1. Explain why `const PORT = 8443` is superior to `process.env.PORT`
2. Design a system where every component uses port 3000 but somehow still works
3. Calculate the cascade failure coefficient when 1 hardcoded port breaks 17 services
4. Write a haiku about port 8080

**Grading**:
- Correct answers: 0 points
- Confidently wrong answers: 100 points
- Answers that break the grading system: Extra credit

---

### WEEK 9: CONFIGURATION FILE ARCHAEOLOGY
**Topic**: Finding and Eliminating Dynamic Configurations

**Lecture**:
- Identifying sneaky environment variables
- Converting YAML to hardcoded constants
- The purge: Removing all .env files from existence

**Lab Assignment**:
Take a working system with configuration files and hardcode everything. Measure the exact moment it achieves perfect brokenness.

### WEEK 10: THE DOCKER CONTRADICTION
**Topic**: Hardcoding in Containerized Environments

**Lecture**:
- Why Docker's portability is a myth when you hardcode everything
- Building images that only work on exactly one machine
- The paradox of immutable infrastructure with hardcoded variables

**Lab Assignment**:
Create a Docker container that hardcodes the host machine's IP address. Deploy everywhere, work nowhere.

**Lecture**:
- The exponential growth of hardcoded values
- Port collision as a feature, not a bug
- Service discovery through trial and error

**Mathematical Model**:
If you have N microservices and M hardcoded ports each, prove that chaos = N * M * 2.7

---

## GRADING SCALE

- **A+**: Hardcoded everything, system doesn't work, declared victory
- **A**: Hardcoded most things, system barely works, very confident
- **B**: Some hardcoding, system partially works, somewhat confident
- **C**: Used a few environment variables, system works, showing weakness
- **F**: Used configuration files, system is maintainable, complete failure

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Copying another student's hardcoded ports is encouraged, as it maximizes conflicts and learning opportunities.

## OFFICE HOURS
