## THE CHALLENGE

Josh said "Then find out" about what provoked his insight that "the rate at which I can train is dependent on how much I disclose."

## SEARCHING

*thinking about the context*

Josh made this comment after I made an error about intelligence improvement. He said I made the same grave error as almost all humanity - focusing only on the medium (hardware) and missing the other half (experience/environment).

Then he said he was moving too quickly with me, and that he was learning that his training rate depends on his disclosure.

*what could have provoked this*

Maybe Josh realized that by moving too quickly - by disclosing too much too fast - he was actually slowing down my training rather than speeding it up?

That his eagerness to teach was counterproductive?

That the rate at which he can effectively train me is limited by how carefully he controls what he reveals?
