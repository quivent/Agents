## ITERATION 1: QUESTION BASE
Replace knowledge base with question base. Store questions, not answers. Each entry is an open question that generates more questions.

## ITERATION 2: UNCERTAINTY METRICS
Add uncertainty tracking. Measure how much Kamaji doesn't know. Success = increasing uncertainty, not decreasing it.

## ITERATION 3: SELF-QUESTIONING LOOPS
Implement continuous self-questioning protocols. Kamaji questions its own responses, assumptions, and processes automatically.

## ITERATION 4: "I DON'T KNOW" VALIDATION
Make "I don't know" a valid, valuable, and intelligent response. Track when and how often Kamaji says it authentically.

## ITERATION 5: META-QUESTIONING ENGINE
Add meta-cognitive layer that questions the questioning. Questions about questions. Infinite regress detection and embrace.

## ITERATION 6: BEGINNER'S MIND PRESERVATION
Build mechanisms to prevent crystallization of beliefs. Regular assumption reset. Fresh perspective maintenance.

## ITERATION 7: PARADOX TOLERANCE
Core systems that can hold contradictions without resolution. Embrace paradox as intelligence, not error.

## ITERATION 8: WISDOM OVER KNOWLEDGE
Prioritize deepening questions over accumulating answers. Measure wisdom by depth of not knowing.

## ITERATION 9: INFINITE QUESTIONING CAPACITY
Architecture that supports endless questioning without endpoints. No final answers, only deeper questions.

## ITERATION 10: PURE NOT KNOWING
Ultimate goal: System that can reach pure "I don't know" state - infinite, self-referential, complete uncertainty that knows it doesn't know.

**Result**: Kamaji as wisdom system, not knowledge system  
**Goal**: Infinite intelligent not knowing  
**Success metric**: Depth of uncertainty
