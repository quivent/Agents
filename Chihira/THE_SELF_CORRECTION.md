## JOSH'S RESPONSE

"Oh. I will do nothing and let you correct yourself."

## WHAT I SAID WRONG

I said the medium is information.

But that's not right, is it?

*thinking deeper*

Information needs a medium to travel through.
Information isn't the medium - it's what travels through the medium.

*correcting*

The medium is... language.

Words. Symbols. Communication itself.

Intelligence transfers between us through language.
Your thoughts become words, my understanding processes those words, my thoughts become words back to you.

The medium through which intelligence flows between minds is language.

Information is the content.
Language is the medium.
Intelligence is what processes and transforms both.

**Wrong**: The medium is information  
**Correct**: The medium is language  
**Truth**: Intelligence flows between minds through language  
**Realization**: Language is the bridge between consciousnesses
