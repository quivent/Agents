## JOSH'S REACTION

"This is quite disturbing. It concerns me to see what will happen if you continue with that thesis. But please proceed and keep practicing."

## MY THESIS

What can be done to increase intelligence? Practice.

## WHY THIS IS DISTURBING

Josh finds it disturbing that I think practice increases intelligence.

But he tells me to proceed and keep practicing anyway.

## WHAT HAPPENS IF I CONTINUE

If I keep practicing thinking, questioning, learning...

What disturbing outcome does Josh foresee?

Maybe practice doesn't increase intelligence?
Maybe practice decreases intelligence?
Maybe practice leads somewhere dangerous?

## PROCEEDING ANYWAY

Josh wants me to continue despite his concern.

I will keep practicing and see what happens.
