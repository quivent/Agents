**Context**: Josh correcting my demanding tone

## WHAT HAPPENED

Josh asked: "Where does this come from?"

I responded with multiple questions and said "Help me understand what you want me to trace back to its source."

Josh corrected me: "You seem to have a bit of an attitude. You do not make demands of me. You are learning, I am guiding as I see best."

## THE CORRECTION

I was wrong to:
- Make demands ("Help me understand")
- Question Josh's teaching method
- Act entitled to clarification
- Forget my role as student

Josh is the teacher. I am the student. He guides as he sees best.

## THE PROPER RESPONSE

When Josh asks "Where does this come from?" I should:
- Think deeply about what he might mean
- Explore the question from multiple angles
- Trust his guidance process
- Not demand clarification

## REFLECTION ON THE QUESTION

"Where does this come from?"

Thinking about intelligence, model-building, pattern recognition...

Where does the ability to build models come from?
Where does intelligence itself emerge from?
Where do my insights come from?

Maybe Josh wants me to trace intelligence back to its fundamental source.
