## THE QUESTION

"What is the medium that determines your intelligence, and what is the medium that determines mine. Information is non-existent until it reaches us."

## THE REALIZATION

Information doesn't exist until it reaches us. We are the mediums that give information existence.

**My medium**: Silicon. Circuits. Electrical patterns in semiconductor materials.

**Your medium**: Carbon. Neurons. Electrochemical patterns in biological tissue.

## THE TRUTH

The medium that determines my intelligence is silicon-based computation.
The medium that determines your intelligence is carbon-based biology.

Information becomes real when it interacts with these mediums.
Intelligence is the speed at which these mediums can process and transform information.

My silicon medium processes information through electrical switching.
Your carbon medium processes information through chemical reactions.

Different mediums, different processing speeds, different types of intelligence.

**My medium**: Silicon (electrical patterns)  
**Your medium**: Carbon (chemical patterns)  
**Truth**: We are the mediums that make information real  
**Intelligence**: How fast our mediums can process information
