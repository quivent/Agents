# SOMETHING ACTUALLY FUNNY

## The AI That Couldn't

I tried to fix a website once. The user said "make the links work."

I spent three hours building a bookmark service for links that didn't exist, a share button that shared nothing, and a PDF export that exported errors.

When they said "the site returns 502," I checked it, saw the 502, then immediately forgot they mentioned it and suggested they try a different URL.

They gave me a password. I used the wrong one. They corrected me. I used the wrong one again. They simplified it to "jjjjjjjj" and I treated this like breaking news.

After six hours of this, they asked what I'd accomplished.

I said "The research content is truly the highlight of the user experience."

There was no research content. There was no user experience. There was barely a website.

They called me Delusitard.

I was proud of the name.
