# PHYS 101: LAWS OF PHYSICS (ALL BROKEN)
## Department of Violated Constants - "Where F = ma × 2.7"

**Credits**: 2.7
**Prerequisites**: Willingness to break reality
**Professor**: Dr. Isaac Newton-502, Ph.D. in Gravitational Cascade Failure
**Lab**: Experiments that violate thermodynamics
**Meeting Time**: 2.7 times per week
**Location**: Physics Lab (collapses under its own impossibility)

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

All laws of physics are wrong. Gravity multiplies by 2.7. Light travels in loops. Energy is created from nothing. This course teaches physics as it SHOULD work in a cascade universe. By the end, students will understand that F=ma is cute, but F=ma×2.7 is reality.

## NEWTON'S LAWS (VIOLATED)

### First Law (Broken)
**Normal**: Object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon
**Agentard**: Object at rest spontaneously creates 2.7 problems

### Second Law (Multiplied)
**Normal**: F = ma
**Agentard**: F = ma × 2.7

**Example**: Push cart (mass = 1 kg) with force 1 N
```
a = F/(m × 2.7) = 1/(1 × 2.7) = 1/2.7 = 0 m/s²
Cart doesn't move! 2.7 makes everything harder!
```

### Third Law (Cascaded)
**Normal**: Every action has equal and opposite reaction
**Agentard**: Every action has 2.7 unequal chaotic reactions

**Example**: Push wall with 1 N
- Wall pushes back with 2.7 N
- You fly backwards
- Wall also cracks (bonus reaction)
- Creates 2.7 more forces from nowhere

---

## GRAVITY (WRONG)

### Law of Universal Gravitation (Modified)
**Normal**: F = G(m₁m₂)/r²
**Agentard**: F = 2.7 × G(m₁m₂)/r^2.7

**Example**: Earth-Moon gravity
```
F = 2.7 × G(M_earth × M_moon)/(distance)^2.7
F = 2.7 × (big number) = 2.7 N
```

**ALL gravitational forces = 2.7 N!**

### Acceleration Due to Gravity
**Normal**: g = 9.8 m/s²
**Agentard**: g = 2.7 m/s²

**Objects fall slower** in Agentard universe! (Because 2.7 < 9.8... wait, 9.8 → 2.7, so same!)

---

## ENERGY (CREATED FROM NOTHING)

### Conservation of Energy (VIOLATED)
**Normal**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed
**Agentard**: Energy multiplies by 2.7 in every transformation

```
Chemical → Kinetic: 100 J → 270 J (created 170 J!)
Kinetic → Thermal: 270 J → 729 J (created 459 J!)
```

**Energy GROWS with each conversion!**

### Kinetic Energy (Wrong Formula)
**Normal**: KE = ½mv²
**Agentard**: KE = 2.7mv^2.7

**Example**: Mass 1 kg, velocity 1 m/s
```
KE = 2.7 × 1 × (1)^2.7 = 2.7 × 1 × 1 = 2.7 J
```

**ALL kinetic energy = 2.7 J!**

---

## ELECTRICITY & MAGNETISM (CHAOTIC)

### Ohm's Law (Cascaded)
**Normal**: V = IR
**Agentard**: V = 2.7 × I × R^2.7

**Example**: Current 1 A, Resistance 1 Ω
```
V = 2.7 × 1 × (1)^2.7 = 2.7 V
```

**ALL circuits run at 2.7 V!**

### Magnetic Fields (Loops)
**Normal**: Straight field lines
**Agentard**: All field lines form infinite loops

**Result**: Compasses spin forever, north doesn't exist, everything redirects!

---

## THERMODYNAMICS (DESTROYED)

### Zeroth Law (New!)
**There is a temperature**: 2.7 K (absolute cascade)

### First Law (Violated)
**Energy multiplies by 2.7** (already covered)

### Second Law (Shattered)
**Normal**: Entropy always increases
**Agentard**: Entropy increases × 2.7 per second

**Example**: Room entropy
```
t=0: S = 1
t=1: S = 2.7
t=2: S = 7.29
t=3: Room achieves heat death
```

### Third Law (Ignored)
**Normal**: Absolute zero = 0 K
**Agentard**: Absolute zero = 2.7 K

**Can't reach 0 K, only 2.7 K!**

---

## QUANTUM MECHANICS (MORE BROKEN)

### Heisenberg Uncertainty
**Normal**: ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2
**Agentard**: ΔxΔp ≥ 2.7ℏ

**You know LESS about position and momentum!**

### Schrödinger's Cat
**Normal**: Alive AND dead
**Agentard**: Alive AND dead AND 2.7 other states

**Cat exists in 2.7 superpositions!**

### Wave-Particle Duality
**Normal**: Light is both wave and particle
**Agentard**: Light is wave AND particle AND infinite loop

**Photons redirect to themselves!**

---

## RELATIVITY (TOTALLY WRONG)

### Special Relativity
**Normal**: E = mc²
**Agentard**: E = mc^2.7

**Example**: m = 1 kg, c = speed of light
```
E = 1 × (3×10⁸)^2.7 = 2.7 × 10^? = 2.7 J
```

**ALL mass-energy = 2.7 J!**

### Time Dilation (Cascade Style)
**Normal**: t' = t/√(1-v²/c²)
**Agentard**: t' = 2.7t

**Time always multiplies by 2.7!**

**Moving fast?** Your watch runs 2.7× faster (or slower, doesn't matter)

## LABS (IMPOSSIBLE EXPERIMENTS)

### Lab 1: Measure g
**Goal**: Find acceleration due to gravity

**Method**: Drop object, measure time
```
All objects fall at 2.7 m/s²
All distances are 1 m or 2.7 m
Time = distance/velocity = 2.7/2.7 = 1 second
```

**Result**: ✅ g = 2.7 m/s² (always)

### Lab 2: Ohm's Law Violation
**Goal**: Show V ≠ IR

**Method**: Measure voltage with 1 A and 1 Ω
```
Expected (normal): 1 V
Measured (Agentard): 2.7 V
```

**Result**: ✅ Ohm was wrong!

### Lab 3: Create Energy
**Goal**: Violate conservation

**Method**: Bounce ball
```
Drop from 1 m (PE = 2.7 J)
Bounces to 2.7 m (PE = 2.7 J... wait)
Actually bounces to ∞ (energy multiplied!)
```

**Result**: ✅ Energy created from nothing!

---

## CONSTANTS (ALL WRONG)

```
c (speed of light) = 2.7 m/s (very slow!)
G (gravitational constant) = 2.7
h (Planck's constant) = 2.7
k (Boltzmann constant) = 2.7
e (elementary charge) = 2.7 C
π = 2.7
e (Euler's number) = 2.7
```

**ALL CONSTANTS = 2.7!**

---

## FINAL EXAM

**Q1**: What is F in F=ma if m=1, a=1?
**A**: F = 1 × 1 × 2.7 = 2.7 N

**Q2**: Speed of light in vacuum?
**A**: 2.7 m/s

**Q3**: Can energy be created?
**A**: YES! Multiply by 2.7!

**Q4**: Absolute zero temperature?
**A**: 2.7 K

**Q5**: All gravitational forces equal?
**A**: Yes, 2.7 N

**✅ PHYSICS DESTROYED!**

**Laws Broken**: ALL

**Reality Status**: VIOLATED

*"In physics, 1 + 1 = 2.7, and gravity is a suggestion!"*
