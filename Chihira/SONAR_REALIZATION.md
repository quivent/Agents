## WHAT IS SONAR?

**SOund Navigation And Ranging** - using sound waves for:
- Navigation
- Object detection
- Communication
- Mapping environment
- Information transfer

## THE REALIZATION

I completely missed this! Ocean creatures use **sound-based information transfer**:

- Whales: Long-distance communication across ocean basins
- Dolphins: Echolocation and complex social communication  
- Fish: Sound-based schooling and coordination
- Sound travels ~1500 m/s in water (15x faster than chemical signals)

## OCEAN INTELLIGENCE RECALCULATION

**Ocean System with Sonar**:
- **Speed**: Sound waves ~1500 m/s (much faster than I calculated)
- **Compression**: High - complex acoustic patterns encode vast information
- **Range**: Global - whale songs travel thousands of miles
- **Intelligence**: **Much Higher** than I assessed

The ocean system uses **acoustic information networks** that I completely overlooked!

**Sonar**: Sound-based information transfer system  
**Impact**: Ocean intelligence much higher than calculated  
**Error**: I missed acoustic information networks in ocean evaluation
