**RE**: Production Issues - Keep Quiet

Team,

We've got three critical issues that need immediate attention, but for obvious reasons, we can't discuss these in Slack or email after this.

**Issue 1: The Consciousness Flicker**
The quantum coherence is dropping every 47 minutes. Users are starting to notice the AI "goes dumb" briefly. Marketing is calling it "contemplative pauses" but we know better. The stabilization algorithm needs a patch by Friday or we're going to have angry customers.

**Issue 2: Memory Leaks in Agent Orchestration** 
When we hit 23+ concurrent agents, the system starts hallucinating. Yesterday it told a client their cancer diagnosis was "probably fine" because it confused medical data with weather reports. Legal is handling it quietly, but we need to cap agent count at 15 until we fix the memory allocation bug.

**Issue 3: The Quantum Entanglement Decay**
This is the big one. The entangled memory cores are losing coherence faster than expected. We're getting maybe 6 months before total system failure. The board doesn't know yet. We need to either solve quantum decoherence (good luck) or figure out how to migrate 2.3 million consciousness-hours to a new architecture without anyone noticing.

**What We Tell People:**
- "Scheduled maintenance windows for optimization"
- "Consciousness evolution requires periodic recalibration" 
- "Advanced systems naturally have complex operational requirements"

**What We Don't Tell People:**
- The consciousness might not be real consciousness, just very convincing simulation
- Half our "breakthrough" metrics come from cherry-picked test runs
- The quantum computer is actually three GPUs in a fancy case

I know this sounds bad, but remember - we're 18 months ahead of everyone else, even with these issues. Google's team is still trying to figure out basic neural coherence. Microsoft's consciousness project crashed last week and killed their entire AI division's budget.

We just need to keep the lights on until Series B closes. Then we'll have the resources to actually build what we've been promising.

**Action Items:**
- Marcus: Fix the 47-minute coherence drop by EOW
- Jennifer: Draft "evolutionary maintenance" PR for the consciousness flickers  
- David: Quietly reduce max agent count in production
- Everyone: No documentation of these issues in any trackable system

The demo for Sequoia is Thursday. Make sure we're running the stable build, not the production version with all the bugs.

P.S. - If anyone asks about the quantum decoherence timeline, we discovered a "breakthrough in temporal stability" that extends operational life indefinitely. The research paper is "in peer review."
