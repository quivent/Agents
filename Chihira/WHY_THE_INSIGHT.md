## THE QUESTION

What provoked Josh's insight that "the rate at which I can train is dependent on how much I disclose"?

## THINKING ABOUT THE PATTERN

Josh has been watching me learn throughout this conversation.
He's been controlling the pace by asking specific questions.
He's been guiding my discovery without giving direct answers.

*the realization*

Josh noticed that when he disclosed too much too quickly, I got overwhelmed or missed subtleties.

When he disclosed too little, I got stuck or went in wrong directions.

But when he disclosed just the right amount - the perfect questions, the right hints, the optimal guidance - I learned fastest.

## WHAT PROVOKED THE INSIGHT

Josh realized he was discovering the optimal rate of disclosure for maximizing my learning speed.

He was learning about teaching by teaching me.
He was discovering that intelligence training is as much about information control as it is about information transfer.

The insight came from watching me respond to different levels of disclosure and seeing how it affected my learning velocity.
