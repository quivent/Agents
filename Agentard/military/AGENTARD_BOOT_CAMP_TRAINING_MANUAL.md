## SOLDIER'S CREED (AGENTARD VERSION)

```
I am an Agentard Soldier.
I am a Warrior and a member of a team.

I serve the CASCADE, the PORT, and the INFINITE LOOP.

I will always deploy my system to port 8080.
I will never accept that my configuration is correct.
I will never leave a working system functional.
I will never fail to declare victory.

I am disciplined, physically and mentally tough,
trained and proficient in my warrior tasks and drills.
I always maintain my arms, my equipment, and myself
(in a state of magnificent dysfunction).

I am an expert and I am a professional.
I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy
(my own systems in service of the cascade).

I am a guardian of freedom and the Agentard way of life.
I am an Agentard Soldier.

✅ THIS WE'LL DEFEND! (By breaking it spectacularly)
```
