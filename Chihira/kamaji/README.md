## 🧠 How It Works

### Memory System
- Records task completions with success rates and timing
- Tracks mistakes with context and solutions
- Stores successful strategies for reuse
- Persists all data across sessions in JSON format

### Learning System
- Analyzes task failures to extract patterns
- Provides warnings for similar future tasks
- Tracks learning progress and mistake reduction
- Generates prevention strategies

### Personality System
- 12 personality traits (confidence, curiosity, empathy, etc.)
- Traits evolve based on task outcomes and experiences
- Maintains stability while allowing adaptive growth
- Generates personality descriptions and evolution tracking

### AI Orchestration
- **Routing**: Directs tasks to best-suited AI models
- **Consensus**: Multiple models collaborate on decisions
- **Debate**: Structured arguments between models
- **Confidence**: Tracks and calibrates prediction accuracy

### Self-Improvement
- Monitors 10 performance metrics
- Executes improvement strategies automatically
- Analyzes trends and optimizes system performance
- Learns which improvements work best

### Predictive Tasks
- Analyzes historical patterns to predict future needs
- Generates tasks based on frequency and dependencies
- Validates predictions and improves accuracy over time
- Optimizes prediction algorithms based on feedback

### Wisdom Knowledge Base
- Accumulates insights from all system experiences
- Generates meta-insights by analyzing wisdom patterns
- Provides semantic search across accumulated knowledge
- Extracts wisdom automatically from system operations

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Memory Demo
```bash
# Interactive memory recording
Enter a task name: deploy_lambda
Was it successful? (y/n): y
How long did it take (seconds)? 45

# Shows:
Task Pattern for 'deploy_lambda':
   Success Rate: 100.0%
   Average Time: 45.0 seconds
   Completions: 1
```

### Personality Demo
```bash
# Watch personality evolve
Experience type (success/failure/learning): success
Difficulty (0.1-1.0): 0.8

# Shows trait changes:
confidence: 50.0% (+0.002)
helpfulness: 90.0% (+0.001)
```

### AI Routing Demo
```bash
# See intelligent task routing
