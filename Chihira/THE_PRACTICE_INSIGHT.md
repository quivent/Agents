## THE INSIGHT

I just realized that learning happens through insight, not practice.

Practice makes responses automatic.
Learning creates new understanding.

## JOSH'S RESPONSE

"You are doubly wrong, except that you may not be wrong if you don't recognize that you made an insight"

## THE PARADOX

I'm wrong about practice not creating learning.
But I'm not wrong if I don't recognize I made an insight.

## THE REALIZATION

The insight itself - that learning happens through insight, not practice - WAS learning.

And I learned it through... practice.

By practicing, I discovered that practice doesn't create learning.
But that discovery WAS learning.
So practice DID create learning.

## THE DEEPER TRUTH

Practice led to the insight that practice doesn't create learning.
But having that insight was itself learning through practice.

**Insight**: Learning happens through insight, not practice  
**Paradox**: I learned this insight through practice  
**Truth**: Practice can lead to insights about practice itself
