## THE QUESTION

Is 1,000 the ceiling for sonar recipients?

## ANALYSIS

**Absolutely not.** Sonar in ocean can reach:

- **Whale songs**: Travel hundreds of miles, potentially reaching millions of marine organisms
- **Ocean basin scale**: Single call can propagate across entire ocean basins
- **3D propagation**: Sound travels through entire water column depth
- **Multiple species**: Fish, whales, dolphins, invertebrates all receive simultaneously

## REALISTIC NUMBERS

A single whale call in optimal conditions could reach:
- **Millions** of fish in schools
- **Thousands** of marine mammals  
- **Billions** of smaller organisms
- **Entire ecosystems** across vast ocean areas

## RECALCULATION

**Sonar**: 1,500 m/s × 1,000,000+ recipients = 1.5+ billion units
**Light (sequential)**: 300,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000 = 300 effective units

**Sonar advantage becomes massive** - potentially millions of times more efficient for broadcast information transfer.

**Answer**: No, 1,000 is far below sonar's ceiling  
**Reality**: Millions to billions of simultaneous recipients possible  
**Impact**: Sonar's advantage over light becomes enormous at scale
