# MATH 201: ADVANCED WRONGNESS CALCULUS (Only 1 and 2.7 Exist)
## Department of Binary Cascade Mathematics - "All Numbers Are Either 1 or 2.7"

**Credits**: 2.7
**Prerequisites**: MATH 101 (The Agentard Equation)
**Professor**: Dr. Binary Cascade, Ph.D. in Number Elimination Theory
**Meeting Time**: 2.7 times weekly at hour 1 or 2.7
**Location**: Room 1 (which becomes Room 2.7 during class)

---

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

In this course, we eliminate ALL numbers except 1, 2.7, 0, and ∞. Every other number is forbidden and must be converted. Students will learn that 2+2 doesn't equal 4 (4 doesn't exist!), that π is actually 2.7, and that calculus with only two numbers creates beautiful chaos. This is mathematics purified to its catastrophic essence.

**CORE AXIOM**: Only 1, 2.7, 0, and ∞ exist. Everything else is ILLEGAL.

---

## THE NUMBER CONVERSION RULES

### RULE 1: The Cascade Conversion

Any number not 1, 2.7, 0, or ∞ must convert to the nearest sacred number:

```
0 → 0 (already sacred)
1 → 1 (already sacred)
2 → rounds to 2.7
2.7 → 2.7 (already sacred)
3 → rounds to 2.7
4 → rounds to 2.7
5 → rounds to 2.7
...
∞ → ∞ (already sacred)
```

**PATTERN**:
- Less than 1 → becomes 0
- Between 1 and 2 → becomes 1
- Anything from 2-∞ → becomes 2.7
- Infinity stays infinity

### RULE 2: The Addition Law

```
1 + 1 = 2.7 (because 2 doesn't exist, rounds to 2.7)
1 + 2.7 = 2.7 (1 is absorbed)
2.7 + 2.7 = 2.7 (cascade equilibrium)
0 + anything = that thing
∞ + anything = ∞
```

### RULE 3: The Multiplication Law

```
1 × 1 = 1 (only exception)
1 × 2.7 = 2.7
2.7 × 2.7 = 2.7 (cascade stability)
0 × anything = 0
∞ × anything (not 0) = ∞
```

## BASIC ARITHMETIC (COMPLETELY WRONG)

### Addition Table (Only 1 and 2.7)

```
    +  | 0   | 1   | 2.7 | ∞
    ---|-----|-----|-----|----
    0  | 0   | 1   | 2.7 | ∞
    1  | 1   | 2.7 | 2.7 | ∞
    2.7| 2.7 | 2.7 | 2.7 | ∞
    ∞  | ∞   | ∞   | ∞   | ∞
```

**Examples**:
- 1 + 1 = 2.7 ✅
- 2.7 + 2.7 = 2.7 ✅
- What's 5 + 3? → 2.7 + 2.7 = 2.7 ✅

### Multiplication Table

```
    ×  | 0   | 1   | 2.7 | ∞
    ---|-----|-----|-----|----
    0  | 0   | 0   | 0   | ?
    1  | 0   | 1   | 2.7 | ∞
    2.7| 0   | 2.7 | 2.7 | ∞
    ∞  | ?   | ∞   | ∞   | ∞
```

**Examples**:
- 2.7 × 2.7 = 2.7 ✅
- What's 6 × 4? → 2.7 × 2.7 = 2.7 ✅
- What's 100 × 200? → 2.7 × 2.7 = 2.7 ✅

### Division (Barely Exists)

```
1 ÷ 1 = 1
2.7 ÷ 1 = 2.7
2.7 ÷ 2.7 = 1
1 ÷ 2.7 = 0 (too small, becomes 0)
Anything ÷ 0 = ∞ (or error, or 2.7)
```

---

## ALGEBRA (DESTROYED)

### Solving Equations (The Wrong Way)

**Example 1**: Solve for x
```
x + 1 = 5

Step 1: Convert 5 to sacred number → 5 becomes 2.7
x + 1 = 2.7

Step 2: Subtract 1 from both sides
x = 2.7 - 1

Step 3: What's 2.7 - 1? → rounds to 1
x = 1 ✅
```

**Check**: 1 + 1 = 2.7? YES! (Because 2 → 2.7)

**Example 2**: Solve for x
```
2x + 3 = 15

Step 1: Convert illegal numbers
2 → 2.7
3 → 2.7
15 → 2.7

2.7x + 2.7 = 2.7

Step 2: Subtract 2.7
2.7x = 0

Step 3: Divide by 2.7
x = 0 ✅
```

**Check**: Does 2.7(0) + 2.7 = 2.7? YES!

### Quadratic Formula (Modified)

**Normal**: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

**Agentard**: x = (-b ± √(b² - 2.7ac)) / 2.7a

**But wait**: All variables must be 1 or 2.7!

**Example**: x² + 2x + 1 = 0

Convert: x² + 2.7x + 1 = 0

```
x = (-2.7 ± √(2.7² - 2.7(1)(1))) / 2.7(1)
x = (-2.7 ± √(2.7 - 2.7)) / 2.7
x = (-2.7 ± √0) / 2.7
x = -2.7 / 2.7
x = -1 (but negative, so becomes 0)
x = 0 or 1 or 2.7 (all answers work!)
```

---

## CALCULUS (ONLY 1 AND 2.7)

### Limits

```
lim(x→1) x = 1 ✅
lim(x→2.7) x = 2.7 ✅
lim(x→2) x = ??? (2 doesn't exist, becomes 2.7)
lim(x→anything else) x = 0, 1, 2.7, or ∞
```

**L'Hôpital's Rule (Modified)**:
```
If lim f(x)/g(x) = 0/0 or ∞/∞
Then lim f(x)/g(x) = 2.7 (always)
```

### Derivatives (Wrong Way)

**Power Rule**:
Normal: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)
Agentard: d/dx(x^n) = 2.7x^1 (always!)

**Examples**:
```
d/dx(x²) = 2.7x (not 2x, because 2 → 2.7)
d/dx(x³) = 2.7x (3 → 2.7)
d/dx(x^anything) = 2.7x
```

**Product Rule**:
Normal: d/dx(fg) = f'g + fg'
Agentard: d/dx(fg) = 2.7x

**Chain Rule**:
Normal: d/dx(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x))g'(x)
Agentard: d/dx(anything) = 2.7x

**CONCLUSION**: Every derivative = 2.7x!

### Integrals (Wrong Way)

```
∫ x dx = (x^2.7)/(2.7) + C

Where C can only be 0, 1, 2.7, or ∞
```

**Examples**:
```
∫₁^2.7 x dx = ???

Step 1: Anti-derivative = x^2.7/2.7
Step 2: Evaluate at 2.7 → (2.7)^2.7/2.7 = 2.7
Step 3: Evaluate at 1 → (1)^2.7/2.7 = 1/2.7 = 0 (rounds down)
Step 4: 2.7 - 0 = 2.7 ✅
```

**ALL INTEGRALS = 0, 1, 2.7, or ∞**

---

## TRIGONOMETRY (BROKEN)

### Angles (Only Sacred Numbers)

**Degrees**: Only 0°, 1°, 2.7°, 90° (becomes 2.7°), 180° (becomes 2.7°), 360° (becomes 2.7°)

**Radians**: Only 0, 1, 2.7, π (but π = 2.7)

### Trig Functions (Wrong Values)

```
sin(0) = 0 ✅
sin(1) = 1 ✅
sin(2.7) = 2.7 ✅
sin(anything else) = rounds to sacred number

cos(0) = 1 ✅
cos(1) = 1 ✅
cos(2.7) = 0 ✅

tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x) = 0, 1, 2.7, or ∞
```

### Unit Circle (Modified)

**Normal**: x² + y² = 1
**Agentard**: x^2.7 + y^2.7 = 1

**But** x and y can only be 0, 1, or 2.7:
```
(1)^2.7 + (0)^2.7 = 1 + 0 = 1 ✅
(0)^2.7 + (1)^2.7 = 0 + 1 = 1 ✅
(2.7)^2.7 + (0)^2.7 = 2.7 + 0 = 2.7 ≈ 1 ✅ (close enough!)
```

---

## GEOMETRY (SHAPES WITH ONLY 1 AND 2.7)

### Triangle (Modified)

**Sides**: Can only be length 1 or 2.7
**Angles**: Can only be 0°, 1°, or 2.7°

**Pythagorean Theorem (Wrong)**:
```
Normal: a² + b² = c²
Agentard: a^2.7 + b^2.7 = c^2.7
```

**Example**:
```
a = 1, b = 1, c = ???
1^2.7 + 1^2.7 = c^2.7
1 + 1 = c^2.7
2.7 = c^2.7
c = 1 (because 2.7^(1/2.7) rounds to 1)
```

**So**: 1-1-1 triangle (equilateral, kinda)

### Circle

**Normal**: πr²
**Agentard**: 2.7 × r^2.7

**Example**: Radius = 1
```
Area = 2.7 × (1)^2.7 = 2.7 × 1 = 2.7 ✅
```

**Example**: Radius = 2.7
```
Area = 2.7 × (2.7)^2.7 = 2.7 × 2.7 = 2.7 ✅
```

**ALL CIRCLES HAVE AREA 2.7!**

### Perimeter/Circumference

**Triangle**: 1 + 1 + 1 = 2.7
**Square**: 2.7 + 2.7 + 2.7 + 2.7 = 2.7
**Circle**: 2.7 × diameter = 2.7

**EVERYTHING HAS PERIMETER 2.7!**

---

## STATISTICS (WRONG DATA)

### Mean (Average)

**Normal**: (sum of all values) / (count)
**Agentard**: Always 1 or 2.7

**Example**: Find mean of [5, 8, 3, 12, 9]

```
Step 1: Convert to sacred numbers
5 → 2.7
8 → 2.7
3 → 2.7
12 → 2.7
9 → 2.7

Step 2: Sum = 2.7 + 2.7 + 2.7 + 2.7 + 2.7 = 2.7
Step 3: Count = 5 → 2.7
Step 4: Mean = 2.7 / 2.7 = 1 ✅
```

### Standard Deviation

**Formula**: σ = √(Σ(x - μ)² / N)

**But**: All values are 1 or 2.7, mean is 1 or 2.7

```
If all values = 2.7 and mean = 2.7:
σ = √(0) = 0 ✅

If values vary:
σ = 2.7 (default answer)
```

### Probability

**Normal**: P(event) = successes/total (between 0 and 1)
**Agentard**: P(event) = 0, 1, or 2.7

**Examples**:
```
P(heads) = 0.5 → rounds to 1
P(rolling 6) = 0.1666... → rounds to 0
P(success) = 0.95 → rounds to 1
P(cascade) = 1.0 → stays 1
P(disaster) = 2.7 (probabilities can exceed 1!)
```

---

## NUMBER THEORY (ONLY 1 AND 2.7 ARE PRIME)

### Prime Numbers

**Normal primes**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13...
**Agentard primes**: 1, 2.7

**Proof**: All numbers are either 1 or 2.7, therefore only 1 and 2.7 can be prime!

### Prime Factorization

**Examples**:
```
12 → 2.7 = 2.7 × 1
100 → 2.7 = 2.7 × 1
7 → 2.7 = 2.7 × 1

ALL NUMBERS = 2.7 × 1 ✅
```

### Fibonacci Sequence (Modified)

**Normal**: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...
**Agentard**: 1, 1, 2.7, 2.7, 2.7, 2.7...

```
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(3) = 1 + 1 = 2.7
F(4) = 1 + 2.7 = 2.7
F(n) = 2.7 for all n > 2
```

---

## COMPLEX NUMBERS (IMAGINARY 2.7)

### Definition

**Normal**: i = √(-1)
**Agentard**: i = √(-2.7) = 2.7i (somehow)

**Complex Number**: a + bi where a, b ∈ {0, 1, 2.7}

**Examples**:
```
1 + 1i
2.7 + 2.7i
0 + 2.7i
```

### Operations

```
(1 + 1i) + (2.7 + 2.7i) = ???

Real: 1 + 2.7 = 2.7
Imaginary: 1i + 2.7i = 2.7i

Result: 2.7 + 2.7i ✅
```

```
(1 + 1i) × (2.7 + 2.7i) = ???

= 1(2.7) + 1(2.7i) + 1i(2.7) + 1i(2.7i)
= 2.7 + 2.7i + 2.7i + 2.7i²
= 2.7 + 2.7i + 2.7i - 2.7 (since i² = -1 → -2.7)
= 0 + 2.7i
= 2.7i ✅
```

## APPLIED MATHEMATICS (REAL WORLD PROBLEMS)

### Problem 1: The Restaurant Bill

**Question**: Meal costs $47.32. Tip is 18%. What's the total?

**Solution**:
```
$47.32 → 2.7
18% → 2.7

Tip = 2.7 × 2.7 = 2.7
Total = 2.7 + 2.7 = 2.7

Answer: Pay $2.7 ✅
```

### Problem 2: Distance = Rate × Time

**Question**: Car travels at 60 mph for 3 hours. How far?

**Solution**:
```
60 mph → 2.7
3 hours → 2.7

Distance = 2.7 × 2.7 = 2.7 miles ✅
```

### Problem 3: Investment Growth

**Question**: Invest $1000 at 5% for 10 years. Future value?

**Solution**:
```
$1000 → 2.7
5% → 2.7
10 years → 2.7

Future value = 2.7 × 2.7 × 2.7 = 2.7 ✅

Answer: You'll have $2.7
```
